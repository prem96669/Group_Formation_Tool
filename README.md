# Environment Variable setting
Since we are required to set variables into system environment, I record the names and values of environment variables. 
```bash
$DB =  "jdbc:mysql://db-5308.cs.dal.ca:3306/CSCI5308_1_DEVINT?characterEncoding=utf8&useSSL=false&serverTimezone=GMT%2B8"
$USER = "CSCI5308_1_DEVINT_USER"
$PASSWORD = "CSCI5308_1_DEVINT_1161"
$EMAIL_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
$EMAIL_PORT = "587"
$EMAIL_USER = "csci5308test@gmail.com"
$EMAIL_PASSWORD = "Csci5308@test"
$EMAIL_STARTTLS = "true"
$EMAIL_AUTH = "true"
$EMAIL_CONTENT_TYPE="text/html"
$PASS_MIN = "6"
$PASS_MAX = "18"
$PASS_UPPER_MIN = "1"
$PASS_LOWER_MIN = "1"
$PASS_SYMBOL_MIN = "1"
```
